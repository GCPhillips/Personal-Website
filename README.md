## Personal Website
My personal website developed with React.  The site is deployed using AWS Amplify at [https://www.grant-phillips.com](https://www.grant-phillips.com).

## Installation and Setup
`node` and `npm` are needed for this project.  After cloning the project, run `npm install`.

## Technology Used
- React
- AWS Amplify
- AWS Route 53
- HTML/CSS/JS


### Notes
I wanted to build this site mainly to keep track of different projects I have worked on.  Having a timeline to chart out my professional journey was also a necessity.  I chose React as the main framework since I enjoy the idea of working with components for reusability and breaking apart responsibilities.
In the future, I'd like to investigate implementing a simple database to keep track of:
- Visitor count
- Personal Projects (to remove hard-coding)
- Personal Timeline (also to remove hard-coding)
